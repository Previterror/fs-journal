3. What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?

5. What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?

6. What is the package.json file used for?

  > It's a file that lists and configures all the dependencies for your application.

7. Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?

  > v-if, v-else-if, v-else, v-for; there might be more, but I don't know what they are!

8. What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?
