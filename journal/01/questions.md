# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > To store our work and be able to return to known working versions if we ruin everything.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > Creates a new folder.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A pseudo class is a special kind of css selector. You will probably use hover, checked, and visited frequently.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is a sort of hierarchy for applying css rules, the higher the specficity the more that rule is likely to trump another rule.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Suddenly everything is important, which means nothing is important and it's no longer easy to style your page.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > a selector(h1), a property(color), and a value(rgba(255, 210, 33, .75))

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Good design can funnel people to certain pages of your site or make certain things easier such as reading large amounts of text. You can communicate a lot of tone and who you expect to use the website through the design.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframing allows you to mock up your website or app so that everyone involved can see what the plan for the UX is and how it conveys information.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > It is always worth mocking up a design and getting the other team members feedback before going and spending a bunch of time on something without being sure everyone is on the same page.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Display flex allows for styling your website more **flexibly** especially when sizes of elements may not be known. You can easily choose how to stack your elements in a flex box as well as aligning and justifying them.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > Margin, border, padding. Margin adds extra space outside of the element, border creates a divide between the element and the rest of the site, padding adds extra space inside of the element.
